HOW TO RUN:
(Program uses Python so it will be needed to be downloaded
on the system)
1) Place the commands text file in the same directory as "project1.py"
2) Name that text file: "input.txt"
3)  In terminal, change directories into the directory 
    which contains both files, and 
    enter "python3 project1.py" or (depends on machine)
    "python project1.py" and if you want to redirect it 
    to a file, "python3 project1.py > output.txt"

LIST OF FILES IN ZIP:
1) "project1.py": main python file that has ALL the code
    including the class "OSManager" which handles all the objects
    needed to properly manage everything.
2) "README.md": describes how to run and list of files in zip
